****************************************************************************

This directory contains all of the files and scripts related to tomato loci. 
Below is a description of what you can do with the scripts in this directory. 
The files and scripts are written in this order:

input file -> script -> output file

****************************************************************************

1. Extracting GenBank mRNA and unigene sequences from the database

loci_compilation.pl -> loci_sequences.fasta


IMPORTANT: loci_sequences.fasta will need to be renamed to end with the suffix 
           .sanger.fasta in order for MIRA to recognize it.

NOTE: In order to run MIRA, unique ids for the sequences were necessary.
      Therefore, the ids were created in this manner:


GenBank mRNA sequences - "SGN-L" + locus_id   + GenBank accession

unigene sequences      - "SGN-U" + unigene_id + locus_id


In other words, the locus_id appears first in the GenBank sequences but second
in the unigene sequences. If desired, the order can be switched so that the 
locus_id always appears first (but all of the other scripts in the
cxgn/Phenome/bin/loci_consensi directory must be checked for other necessary
switches).



2. Running MIRA to align the sequences and find tentative consensus sequences
   for each tomato locus

To run MIRA, use the call parameters found in:
loci2_info_callparameters.txt

Change parameters and names as necessary.



3. Creating an easy-to-read file to determine which sequences create 
   which consensus

loci2_info_contigreadlist.txt -> contig_loci2_matching.pl -> contig_loci2_matches.txt



4. Determining the consensus sequences which have errors (i.e. having sequences
   that appear in two or more other consensus sequences)

contig_loci2_matches.txt -> loci2_mismatches.pl -> loci2_mismatches.txt
                                                -> loci2_mismatches_tab.txt 

NOTE: loci2_mismatches_tab.txt is simply a tabular formatted version
      of loci2_mistmatches.txt.



5. Converting an ace file to an aligned multi-FASTA file

loci2_out.ace -> create_multifasta.pl -> loci2_out_multi.fasta

NOTE: This partially uses Vera Kutsenko's code, which is located in
cxgn/cxgn-corelibs/lib/CXGN/BioTools/AceTools.pm



IMPORTANT: All of the input and output files were originally  hard-coded 
in the scripts. So if the scripts do not work on your computer, it is probably
because I messed up while trying to fix the file paths.


For the mason component that creates an image of the alignment, please go to
cxgn/sgn/mason/loci_consensi/loci_consensi_result.mas. It is currently
incomplete (and very messy. You are almost better off writing a new mason 
component altogether...).

It needs to be added to the locus mason pages. It should also probably be moved
to another directory.
