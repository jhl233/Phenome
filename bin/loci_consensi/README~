This directory contains all of the files and scripts related to tomato loci. This includes:

1. Extracting GenBank mRNA and unigene sequences from the database

2. Running MIRA to align the sequences and find tentative consensus sequences
   for each tomato locus

3. Creating an easy-to-read file of which sequences create which consensus

4. Determining the consensus sequences which have errors (i.e. having sequences
   that appear in two or more other consensus sequences)

5. Converting an ace file to an aligned multi-FASTA file
